This is a cordless HDMI plug that only needs a power cable and is compatible with a bunch of different devices.

https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ueBR86_Q_00,storytime Shorts,"What's your I-did-not-see-that-one-coming story? For months, my son Toby had this stupid cough. He was nine years old, and it kept coming back every couple weeks. Not all the time, just when he ran around too much or played soccer. I took him to our doctor three different times. Each visit, same story. It's probably allergies, they said. Maybe post-nasal drip. They gave us some medicine, told him to take it easy, and sent us home. But it kept getting worse. One Saturday after soccer practice, Toby coughed so hard he almost passed out right there on the field. His face went white, and he grabbed onto my arm like he was drowning. I rushed him to urgent care immediately. They checked everything. His breathing, his heart. Even did some blood tests. Nothing dangerous, they said. Just keep giving him the allergy meds. That night I was lying in bed thinking about it. Something felt off. The cough always seemed worse when we were at home, and it was only bad when we were upstairs. I started paying attention over the next few days. At school, no cough. When we stayed at my sister's house during the power outage last month, nothing. But upstairs in our house, especially in his bedroom, that's when it got really bad. So I did something that probably sounds crazy. I went online and bought one of those air quality monitors. You know, the kind that beeps if there's bad stuff in the air. When it arrived two days later, I plugged it in upstairs in Toby's room. Within ten minutes, this thing started screaming like a fire alarm. The screen was flashing red and showing these numbers I didn't understand, but I knew they were bad. I called the company's helpline. The guy on the phone got really quiet when I read him the numbers. Sir, you need to get your family out of that room immediately, he said. Those are toxic levels of formaldehyde. I didn't even know what that meant. But I moved Toby downstairs that same night. The next day, I started tearing his room apart. I pulled out his mattress, checked behind all the furniture, even looked under the carpet. Nothing made sense. The room looked normal. Then I remembered the built-in closet we had installed about two years ago. We hired this contractor I found online because he was way cheaper than everyone else. Big mistake. I got my tools and started ripping out the baseboard around the closet. That's when I found it. Behind the wood paneling was black mold so thick it looked like someone had painted the wall with tar. And underneath that was this old wooden beam that was completely rotted through. It was soaked with something that smelled like sewage mixed with glue. The whole thing was disgusting. I called a hazmat cleanup team that same day. They came out wearing those white suits like you see in the movies. After they finished cleaning everything out, Toby's cough disappeared completely. Just gone. I felt terrible that I hadn't figured it out sooner. But at least we solved it. But here's where it gets really weird. While I was packing up some of Toby's things from his room before the cleanup, I found this crumpled piece of paper stuck way down inside one of the loose floorboards. It was a letter written in purple ink by someone with really neat handwriting. The paper was old and yellowed around the edges. The letter was dated August 1997. It said, If anyone finds this, please tell my mom I didn't run away. I was trapped here. He kept me in the walls. He said I made too much noise coughing. It was signed, Samira. I stared at that letter for probably ten minutes, just trying to process what I was reading. My hands were shaking. I immediately called the police. They took the letter and started asking me all kinds of questions about the house and the previous owner. Two weeks later, a detective called me back. They had looked into it and found that Samira was a missing child case from 1997. She was twelve years old and had been living with a foster family. Her foster father was the main suspect, but they never had enough evidence to charge him. And get this. My house used to belong to him. The detective told me they were going to search the property with ground-penetrating radar. Three days later, they found her. She was buried in the crawlspace under the house, right below where Toby's room used to be. After twenty-eight years, Samira's family finally got answers. The foster father had died five years ago, so there was never going to be a trial, but at least they could have closure. Her mom sent me a letter thanking me for finding Samira's note and giving her daughter peace.",-0.12024318274318276,0.39097800347800327,disgust,disgust,fear,"['Toby', 'Samira', 'Samira', 'Samira', 'Samira']","['Toby', 'Toby', 'Toby', 'Toby', 'Toby', 'Toby']",[],[],[]

How disappointing. When I got into my dream college, she called admissions and tried to decline my acceptance because state school would be more appropriate for someone of your abilities. She didn't even leave my boyfriend out of it, announcing at family dinner that he was doing charity work by dating down. When I bought my first house, she posted on Facebook that I'd finally found a place that matches my low standards, with photos highlighting every flaw. If I even confronted her about any of this, she'd call other relatives immediately. I'm worried about her mental health. She keeps imagining I said terrible things when all I've ever done is support her. Maybe she needs some professional help. The breaking point came last winter when my appendix burst and I was rushed into emergency surgery. I called my mother while terrified and in pain, begging her to come give me some assurance. She sighed at my voice and said, Do you even realize how disappointed I am that my only child can't even stay healthy? Sarah's mother never has to deal with hospital visits. She hung up before I could respond. While nurses prepped me for surgery, I checked Facebook one last time. My mom had posted 10 minutes after our call. Some days, I wish I could just start over with a child who doesn't constantly disappoint me. It's like I might as well not have one at all. My own friends were texting me screenshots, horrified that my mother would write this while I was being wheeled into surgery. That's when something inside me snapped into place. She wanted to act like she didn't have a child, so I'd give her exactly what she asked for. I decided to lean into her declaration. If she wished she didn't have a child, then I'd honor that wish. I started simple. Changed my voicemail to a memorial message. Then I had funeral flowers delivered to her house, laying the foundation perfectly. Mom called me 37 times that day. I didn't answer. Next, I sent sympathy cards to all our relatives. Thinking of you during this difficult time of loss, they read. I signed them, A friend who cares. Whenever I ran into her church friends at the grocery store, I'd mention casually that I was planning a memorial service. Since mom declared she might as well not have a child, I figured I should honor her wishes. I'd say with a sad smile. It's what she wanted. Word spread fast through her social circles. People started asking mom about the service. She tried explaining I wasn't actually dead, but that made her look even worse. So you said you don't have a child, but you do? They'd ask. That's really messed up, Helen. The masterpiece came together when I scheduled my memorial for the same day as her charity club's Mother's Day luncheon. I rented the community center directly across the street from the country club. Put up a big sign. Memorial service for Helen's child. I sent invitations to everyone. Helen recently declared she might as well not have a child at all. Please join us in acknowledging her loss. Light refreshments will be served. I included a screenshot of her Facebook post. The turnout was incredible. Turns out I wasn't the only one mom had hurt. Relatives poured in. Even cousin Sarah showed up. Meanwhile, mom's luncheon had maybe 12 ladies who kept glancing at my memorial through the windows. Every time someone left her a vent to check out mine, she got more frantic. She finally stormed into my memorial, face purple with rage. This is ridiculous. You're not dead. I'm simply honoring what you posted, mom. You said you might as well not have a child. Mom left in tears, but not before snarling that I disappointed her one last time. The fallout was immediate, with her charity asking her to resign. Her Facebook posts were full of comments calling her the worst mother ever. Even her church friends stopped inviting her to get-togethers. And the best was that she couldn't play victim without explaining why her daughter was holding a memorial for herself. She'd trapped herself completely. Six months later, mom tells people I'm dramatic, but she stopped posting about disappointments and stopped comparing me to Sarah. She even sent a letter begging for reconciliation and asking me to tell people she was a good mother. But I just burnt it.",0.05648148148148149,0.503042328042328,sadness,fear,anger,"['Sarah', 'B+', 'Sarah', 'Helen', 'Sarah', 'Sarah']",[],['Helen'],[],[]

In school, I was teased mercilessly. Kids called me Mini Soda, or just Soda Can. My parents insisted that everyone use my full name, saying it was a badge of honor. Even teachers winced when calling roll. By the time I turned 18, I was done. I legally changed my name to Nina, and didn't tell a soul. College was a fresh start.

https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TFdGaOhhN3Y,storytime Shorts,"Parents, when did you know you raised your child right? When my 14-year-old daughter, Lily, asked if she could go to the mall with her friends. Nothing unusual, just teenagers being teenagers. I handed her some cash, reminded her not to stay out too late, and went back to folding laundry, thinking nothing of it. A few hours later, my phone rang. Unknown number. Hello? This is Officer Daniels from the city police. Your daughter is at the station. You should come right away. My stomach dropped. Is she hurt? What happened? I'll explain when you get here, ma'am. That drive felt endless. My mind raced with every possible worst-case scenario. When I arrived, I spotted Lily in a chair, pale but oddly calm. She gave me a small, tight smile, the kind that said, I'm fine, but I'm not sure you'll think so. The officer began, Your daughter stopped a theft at the mall. She followed the suspect into the parking garage. That could have gone very wrong. I turned to her, stunned. You did what? She explained she'd been in a small jewelry store when she noticed a man slipping a diamond necklace into his jacket. No one else seemed to notice. She froze for a moment, debating whether to say something, but when he walked out casually, she followed at a distance, texting the store owner about what she'd seen. The man descended into the dim parking garage. Lily noticed a young woman leaning over a stroller, adjusting a blanket. The man kept glancing around, as if deciding his next move. That's when Lily, heart-pounding, walked right up to him and said, The police are already here. I'm sending them your location right now. If you give it to me and leave, you might walk away without handcuffs. Her phone was in her hand, thumb hovering over the screen. The man froze mid-step. He stared at her, his expression flickering between suspicion and fear. Finally, with a muttered curse, he shoved the necklace into her hands and hurried off into the shadows. Lily immediately handed the necklace to the store owner, who called security. Security called the police. Officer Daniels leaned closer to me, lowering his voice. Ma'am, that suspect is wanted for several violent robberies. Your daughter had no way of knowing that. My knees nearly buckled. You mean she could have? Yes, he interrupted gently, but she didn't hesitate to protect a stranger. On the drive home, I tried to lecture her for putting herself in danger, but the words caught in my throat. She stared out the window, her reflection small against the passing streetlights. Finally, she whispered, Mom, there was a baby. I wasn't going to let him hurt her. Hours later, just as we were settling in for the night, there was a knock at the door. I opened it to see the young mother from the parking garage, cradling her baby in one arm. She looked at Lily with tear-filled eyes. I just, I had to thank you in person, she said.

https://www.youtube.com/shorts/18izpsejn5M,storytime Shorts,"Gave my ex a surprise when I left unexpectedly. Three months ago, I was living with my ex-girlfriend, Ashley, and we were splitting a one-bedroom apartment. She worked at some boutique downtown, making like $12 an hour, but acted like she was running her own fashion empire. I was doing night shifts at a warehouse, making decent money, but she always complained I was never home enough, or that I smelled like cardboard when I got back. The thing is, Ashley had this weird habit of going through my stuff when she thought I wasn't paying attention. She'd check my phone when I was in the shower, go through my wallet while I was sleeping, and even rearrange my dresser drawers, claiming she was just helping me stay organized. I caught her doing it multiple times, but every time I brought it up, she'd flip it around and say I was being paranoid or controlling. What really got to me was when she started opening my mail. Not just bills or whatever, but personal stuff too. She opened a birthday card from my grandma with $50 in it, and when I asked her about it, she said the envelope was already torn and she was just trying to help. The money was sitting right there on the counter, so I couldn't prove she took any, but something felt off. Then last month, I ordered this vintage baseball card I'd been wanting since I was a kid. Cost me like $200, but it was mint condition and from my favorite player. The package showed up while I was at work, and when I got home, Ashley was acting all weird and nervous. When I asked about packages, she said nothing came, but I had the tracking info showing it was delivered. I went to our apartment manager's office the next day and asked to see the security footage from our hallway. Sure enough, there was Ashley taking my package inside. When I confronted her, she broke down crying, saying she sold it on eBay because she needed money for some emergency. Turned out the emergency was a pair of boots she saw online. That's when I decided I was done, but I wasn't just going to pack up and leave like a normal person. Ashley had this thing where she kept a journal under her mattress that she wrote in every single night. She thought I didn't know about it, but I'd seen her writing in it plenty of times. She'd always cover it up real quick if I walked by and hide it immediately after. So I came up with my plan. I waited until she went to work one Saturday morning and I knew she'd be gone for eight hours. I carefully lifted up her side of the mattress and found the journal. Instead of reading it, I left it exactly where it was, but I put a tiny piece of tape on the cover that would break if anyone opened it. Then I packed up all my stuff while leaving everything that looked like mine still in place. I took my clothes, but left empty hangers. Took my gaming console, but left the controllers plugged into nothing. Moved out my dresser, but left the drawer handles on the floor where it used to be. I even took my half of the shower curtain so there was just this weird gap in the bathroom. But here's the best part. I wrote her a note and put it inside her journal, right on the page she'd probably write on next. The note said, Hey Ashley, since you love going through my stuff so much, I figured you wouldn't mind if I went through yours. Don't worry, I only read the parts where you wrote about cheating on me with Brad from your work. Hope you two are happy together. By the way, I'm keeping the security deposit since you owe me 200 bucks for my baseball card. Have fun explaining to the landlord why half the apartment is missing. The thing is, I never actually read her journal. But I knew she was paranoid enough to think I did. And I was pretty sure she was cheating based on how she'd been acting lately. It was basically a shot in the dark, but I figured if I was wrong, she'd just be confused. And if I was right, she'd probably freak out. I left that Saturday afternoon and drove to my buddy's place where I'd already arranged to crash on his couch. Around 11 that night, my phone started blowing up with texts and calls from Ashley. First, she was confused. Then angry. Then crying. Then angry again. The messages went from, Where are you? To, What did you do to my apartment? To, How dare you read my journal? To, Please come back. We can work this out. But the one that confirmed everything was when she texted, I can explain about Brad, it's not what you think. So I was right about the cheating. I never responded to any of her messages and I blocked her number the next day.",0.03748759920634921,0.4628720238095238,surprise,neutral,neutral,"['Ashley', 'Ashley', 'Ashley', 'Ashley', 'Ashley', 'Hey Ashley', 'Brad', 'Brad']",['eBay'],['Ashley'],[],[]

https://www.youtube.com/shorts/g8zHRFPlZdU,storytime Shorts,"My daughter's teacher stole her phone and failed to recognize her panic attack during class. My daughter's 16F new Spanish teacher refuses to let any students have their phone in class and collects them at the door. She believes that students will just use their phones to cheat and won't let any students stay in her class unless they give her their phones. The problem with that is that my daughter went through a traumatic experience in middle school and has been unable to be away from her phone since. Basically, her middle school went into lockdown and all her teacher and fellow students knew was that there might be an active shooter on campus. My daughter texted me absolutely terrified and as I tried to figure out what was going on, I got dozens of texts from my daughter's phone. They were all messages her classmates wished for me to share with their families if anything happened to them. It was heartbreaking. The lockdown was lifted after an hour of silence and I learned later there was gunfire reported nearby. I will always be grateful that's all it was. Since that day, she has been unable to part from her phone because she's terrified something like that might happen again and she wants to be able to contact me. She said panic attacks before when her phone dies unexpectedly. She is currently in therapy and working past it. But for now I told her that if a teacher ever has an issue to just say I have a rule that she must have her phone on her at all times. It's never been a problem, until now. When the teacher asked for my daughter's phone, she explained she can't part with it. It turned into a back and forth, so my daughter said she'd be willing to go to the principal's office and have them call me. But she couldn't give up her phone. Instead of listening, her teacher snatched my daughter's phone away and told her to go sit down. My daughter listened to her and told me later that she tried really hard to use breathing tactics her therapist taught her. But in the end, the idea of being in a classroom with no access to her phone terrified her too much and she had a horrible panic attack. Apparently the teacher ignored her and told other students to ignore her tantrum until one of her friends yelled that she needed to go to the nurse. The teacher told them to stop being so dramatic and focus on her lesson. My daughter's friend ended up grabbing my daughter and walking out of the classroom to go to the nurse's office. Thankfully, everything ended up okay and the nurse let her hold on to her own cell for a while, which calmed her down. They called me to inform me of what happened, but said I needed to come in to discuss my daughter's behavior issues before school let out. Apparently her new teacher felt incredibly disrespected by my daughter and was insisting on having a group meeting with my daughter and her friend with their parents. During the meeting, she laid out what happened and I explained it was important my daughter keep her phone and while she should have communicated better, I stand by her decision. The teacher insisted that both my daughter and her friend get detention for their disrespect, but all of us thought that was ridiculous. The parents of the friend said their daughter was only helping a friend and did nothing wrong and I agreed. The principal tried to be a mediator between us, but it only got worse as we asked for our daughter's phones back and the teacher refused, saying until our daughters could learn to respect the rules, she would not be giving anyone their phones back. I was furious and threatened to call the police on her for theft and the teacher tried to say that she had misplaced the phones anyway so it would be a while before she could find them. I said this entire thing is ridiculous and asked if my daughter could just switch classes. The Spanish teacher said she wasn't okay with that as that would be showing failure and teaching my daughter that it's okay to always get your way. She said either my daughter comes to class, follows the rules and does the work or she would fail her right there and then. I asked the principal if he agreed with everything she said and he told the teacher that wasn't something she could just do. I had had enough at that point so I dialed 911 right there in front of everyone and spoke to the operator, explaining that my daughter's teacher had stolen my daughter's phone and was refusing to return it. That got the principal to actually do something and insisted the teacher go get the phones right away. After she left I explained nicely and calmly that my daughter would be moved into another class immediately to fulfill her credit requirements or I would be speaking to the board about how a teacher ignored a child having a medical emergency and how the principal sided with the teacher as well. The other parents agreed with me and said they'd better do the same for their daughter as well.
