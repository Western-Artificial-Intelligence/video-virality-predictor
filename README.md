# video-virality-predictor

Project Overview: This project aims to develop an AI-driven system that identifies the key latent attributes in short-form social media content across video, audio, and text modalities that drive virality. By quantifying the impact of these characteristics, the project seeks to uncover actionable patterns that consistently predict and guide the creation of high-engagement content across diverse niches.

 Methods to achieve this
 1) Multimodal Representation: break the video down into all of its different input types for analysis (text, audio, video, etc)
 2) Latent structure discovery: reduce dimensionality of represented types into indiviudal latent spaces to identify driving characteristic for virality in purest form
 3) Virality Structure Forecasting: use structure disovery as basis of virality forecasting via supervised learning models 

 Environment: Add all code dependencies into requirements.txt file so environemnt setup can be as easy as using that file to download nessecary libraries

 Repo standards: Just keep file names & folders organized/named accordingly and I will be a happy man
